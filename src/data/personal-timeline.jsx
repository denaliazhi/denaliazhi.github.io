          Over four years, I'd design for two startups, a nonprofit, and a
          student publication in my free time. These experiences would hone my
          eye for detail and composition.

          I'd go on to pursue a minor in CS along with a tech-y concentration at
          the business school. I'd tackle courses like Data Structures, Database
          Management, and Data-Driven Decision Making.

          While I was strengthening my analytical skills, however, I became less
